##################### ElasticSearch Configuration Example #####################

# This file contains an overview of various configuration settings,
# targeted at operations staff. Application developers should
# consult the guide at <http://elasticsearch.org/guide>.
#
# The installation procedure is covered at
# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html>.
#
# ElasticSearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings,
# so you can try it out without bothering with configuration.
#
# Most of the time, these defaults are just fine for running a production
# cluster. If you're fine-tuning your cluster, or wondering about the
# effect of certain configuration option, please _do ask_ on the
# mailing list or IRC channel [http://elasticsearch.org/community].

# Any element in the configuration can be replaced with environment variables
# by placing them in ${...} notation. For example:
#
# node.rack: ${RACK_ENV_VAR}

# For information on supported formats and syntax for the config file, see
# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html>


################################### Cluster ###################################

# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running
# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names.
#
cluster.name: "swarmee"


#################################### Node #####################################

# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved
# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:
#
node.name: "swarmee1"

# Every node can be configured to allow or deny being eligible as the master,
# and to allow or deny to store the data.
#
# Allow this node to be eligible as a master node (enabled by default):
#
node.master: true
#
# Allow this node to store data (enabled by default):
#
node.data: true

# You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies.
#
# 1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data.
#    This will be the "workhorse" of your cluster.
#
# node.master: false
# node.data: true
#
# 2. You want this node to only serve as a master: to not store any data and
#    to have free resources. This will be the "coordinator" of your cluster.
#
# node.master: true
# node.data: false
#
# 3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but
#    to act as a "search load balancer" (fetching data from nodes,
#    aggregating results, etc.)
#
# node.master: false
# node.data: false

# Use the Cluster Health API [http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health], the
# Node Info API [http://localhost:9200/_cluster/nodes] or GUI tools
# such as <http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/bigdesk> and
# <http://mobz.github.com/elasticsearch-head> to inspect the cluster state.

# A node can have generic attributes associated with it, which can later be used
# for customized shard allocation filtering, or allocation awareness. An attribute
# is a simple key value pair, similar to node.key: value, here is an example:
#
# node.rack: rack314

# By default, multiple nodes are allowed to start from the same installation location
# to disable it, set the following:
# node.max_local_storage_nodes: 1


#################################### Index ####################################


#################################### Paths ####################################

# Path to directory containing configuration (this file and logging.yml):
#
# path.conf: /path/to/conf

# Path to directory where to store index data allocated for this node.
#
# path.data: /path/to/data
#
# Can optionally include more than one location, causing data to be striped across
# the locations (a la RAID 0) on a file level, favouring locations with most free
# space on creation. For example:
#
# path.data: /path/to/data1,/path/to/data2

# Path to temporary files:
#
# path.work: /path/to/work

# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: /usr/share/elasticsearch/logs

# Path to where plugins are installed:
#
# path.plugins: /path/to/plugins


#################################### Plugin ###################################

# If a plugin listed here is not installed for current node, the node will not start.
#
# plugin.mandatory: mapper-attachments,lang-groovy


################################### Memory ####################################


############################## Network And HTTP ###############################

# ElasticSearch, by default, binds itself to the 0.0.0.0 address, and listens
# on port [9200-9300] for HTTP traffic and on port [9300-9400] for node-to-node
# communication. (the range means that if the port is busy, it will automatically
# try the next port).

# Set the bind address specifically (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
# network.bind_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set the address other nodes will use to communicate with this node. If not
# set, it is automatically derived. It must point to an actual IP address.
#
# network.publish_host: 192.168.0.1

# Set both 'bind_host' and 'publish_host':
#
# network.host: 192.168.0.1

# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (9300 by default):
#
# transport.tcp.port: 9300

# Enable compression for all communication between nodes (disabled by default):
#
# transport.tcp.compress: true

# Set a custom port to listen for HTTP traffic:
#
http.port: 9200

# Set a custom allowed content length:
#
# http.max_content_length: 100mb

# Disable HTTP completely:
#
# http.enabled: false
#xpack.monitoring.collection.interval: "120s"
#xpack.watcher.enabled: false
#xpack.ml.enabled: false
#xpack.graph.enabled: false
#xpack.security.audit.enabled: true
#xpack.security.audit.outputs: ["index"]
#xpack.security.enabled: false
